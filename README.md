# Karasu

This is a music bot created by using the [sapphire framework][sapphire] & [discord-player@dev][discord-player] with this project being written in TypeScript.

## Features

- Music system with slash commands
- Hot Module Reloading
- ESlint configuration
- Built-in cooldown system
- Easy to configure and use

### Prerequisite

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
```

### How can I generate a command?

```sh
sapphire generate command <name>
```

This will automatically generate a slash command in the `src/commands` folder from the template in the `templates` folder

### Hot Module Reloading

It is advised to firstly build the dist folder and then use `yarn dev`, this will enable [@sapphire/plugin-hmr][sapphire-hmr] and will actively reload modules when they are updated.
